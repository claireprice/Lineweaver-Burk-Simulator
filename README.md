# Lineweaver–Burk Simulator

A browser-based educational simulator to explore the **Lineweaver–Burk plot** in enzyme kinetics. This tool allows students to adjust kinetic parameters and visually understand the reciprocal transformation of the Michaelis–Menten equation.

## Features

- Interactive plot of **1/v vs 1/[S]**
- Adjustable parameters: **Vmax** and **Km**
- Clear visualisation of slope and y-intercept
- Explanatory annotations to aid learning
- Built-in quiz to reinforce understanding
- Light/dark theme toggle for accessibility

## How to Use

1. Use the sliders to adjust **Vmax** and **Km**.
2. The plot updates to show changes in slope and intercept.
3. Use the quiz to test your understanding.
4. Switch between dark and light mode as you prefer.
